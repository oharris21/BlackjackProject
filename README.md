## Blackjack

* Skill Distillery Week 3 Homework

### Description
This application simulates a game of Blackjack as its name would suggest. The user and dealer are able to interact in a realistic manner on things such as taking cards, betting on a hand, and keeping track of winnings. The logic replicates a real game of Blackjack, making for a fun command line game!

### Technologies Used
* Java
* UML diagrams
* Java Objects and Classes
* String and StringBuilder

### Lessons Learned
This was my second major Object Oriented Project. I learned how to use collection types to organize and manage data as well as to use conditionals to create game logic. 

I got a lot more comfortable building classes in an Object-Oriented manner and the additional 
practice of calling methods across multiple classes was very helpful for my overall understanding of Java.

Features such as interacting with dealer and being able to bet on hands made this project a lot of fun to build and play around with!
